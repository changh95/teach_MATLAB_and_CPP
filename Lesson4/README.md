# Lesson 4 : MATLAB test

You are building a 3D printer with motor controls that are programmed by MATLAB.
You already established a simple interface with MATLAB PC and the motor, which the basic functions such as moveX, moveY, moveZ are provided in this folder.
Since the motors are not perfect, you expect them not to be exact location at the place where you've programmed it to be.
Your task is to analyse the error in position readings, and plot out the acculumated error over a trajectory.

Please take the following tests in order.

1. Initialise motor (initMotor.m)
2. Set trajectory
3. Collect movement data
4. Plot accumulated error
